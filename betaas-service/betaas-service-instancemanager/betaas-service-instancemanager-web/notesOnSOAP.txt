The generation of SOAP classes has been done with SoapUI:
- create a project with the WSDL published by DOSGi
- generate code -> Apache CXF
- set the check boxes Client and Implementation

- in the generated code change the reference to the WSDL from the local path to the path on Tomcat localhost (not necessary)
- fix the errors by removing the parameter "features" from the method calls
- remove the required = false in the @XmlElementRet
- remove accented characters from comments (proprieta')
